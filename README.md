# Git project ðŸš€

As part of a school project focused on practicing Git (best practices, rebasing, cherry-picking), I created a simple webpage using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
This project helped me improve my skills in working with Git and gain a better understanding of using the terminal in VS Code.
